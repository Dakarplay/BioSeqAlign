# BioSeqAlign - DNA Sequence Alignment in Java

## Overview
BioSeqAlign is a Java-based tool for aligning DNA sequences using dynamic programming. It helps identify the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two DNA strands, highlighting similarities that may indicate functional or evolutionary relationships.

## Features
- Implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.
- Efficient sequence alignment using dynamic programming.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Dakarplay/BioSeqAlign.git

2. Navigate to the project:

    cd BioSeqAlign

3. Compile the Java files:

    javac src/*.java

4. Run the program:

    java -cp src Main

## Usage
1. Provide two DNA sequences as input.

2. The program will compute the optimal alignment.

3. The longest common subsequence (LCS) will be displayed as output.

## Example

Input: 

    - Sequence 1: ACTGAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTCCGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAA
    - Sequence 2: TCAAGGGGGTCAAAAAAAAAAACGTGA

Output:

    - Longest Common Subsequence: TAAGGGGGAAAAAAA
